			<center><h4> Subject Layered Portrait </h4></center>
			<center>
			I used pictures like a boat migrating to Malaysia, which was also where my dad went. He got adopted by the American Red Cross there and moved to California with an American family who were originally from Germany. To represent this I used an American flag and a parent and child holding hands. I made sure to make this picture larger than the others because it played one of the most important events in my dadâ€™s life. Migrating to the states affected him a lot because if he stayed in Vietnam he would have never had the education he was able to receive here and he would have also not had the best childhood, but because he was adopted, his step-family treated him like their biological son, despite being a different ethnic background.
